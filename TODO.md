# TabTaskTick - Implementation TODO

## Project Status

**TabMaster Pro V2 Architecture**: ✅ COMPLETE (13 services, 457 tests)
- Services-first architecture proven and battle-tested
- Selection/execution separation established
- Message passing patterns working across all surfaces
- Production release: v1.2.6

**Current Development**: TabTaskTick (Collections + Tasks + Work Management)
- Branch: `main` (active development)
- Version: 1.3.0 (in development)
- Proposal: `/plans/TABTASKTICK-PRODUCT-PROPOSAL-V2.md`

**Evolution Path**: Tab Hygiene → Knowledge Organization → Work Management
- Stage 1 (Complete): Rules, deduplication, grouping, snoozing
- Stage 2 (This Release): Collections as persistent windows with folders
- Stage 3 (This Release): Tasks within collections referencing tabs

**Timeline**: 68-84 hours for MVP, 10 sprints

**Architecture Note**: This plan uses a normalized data model (4 separate object stores with foreign keys) instead of nested documents. This avoids race conditions on concurrent updates and improves query performance. See Architecture Refinements section below.

## Architecture Refinements

Following architecture-guardian review, key improvements from initial plan:

### 1. Normalized Data Model
**Change**: Store collections, folders, tabs, and tasks as separate object stores with foreign key relationships, instead of nesting folders/tabs inside collections.

**Why**:
- Avoids race conditions (updating one tab doesn't require loading entire collection)
- Better transaction control (update only what changes)
- Simpler queries (direct lookups by FK index)
- Follows relational data best practices

**Trade-off**: More complex queries when reassembling full collection hierarchy, but gains significant benefits in write performance and data integrity.

### 2. Storage Utilities, Not Services
**Change**: Create storage query utilities in `/services/utils/` instead of formal storage services layer.

**Why**:
- Utilities are called ONLY by execution services (enforced by architecture)
- Consistent with how chrome.storage.local is used in TabMaster
- Clear separation: utilities = data access, services = business logic
- Avoids creating parallel service architecture

**Pattern**: Execution services use utilities like `saveCollection()`, similar to how SnoozeService uses chrome.storage.local internally.

### 3. Extend WindowService Instead of New Service
**Change**: Add collection binding methods to existing WindowService instead of creating WindowTrackingService.

**Why**:
- WindowService already tracks window lifecycle via `chrome.windows.onRemoved`
- Reuses existing infrastructure (no duplication)
- Single source of truth for window management
- Follows DRY principle

**Implementation**: Add `bindCollectionToWindow()`, `unbindCollectionFromWindow()`, and `getCollectionForWindow()` methods to existing service.

### 4. Keep Collections + Tasks Together
**Decision**: Implement both Collections and Tasks in v1.3.0 (don't split into separate releases).

**Why**:
- Tasks are core to the value proposition (task-driven work)
- Splitting led to deprioritization in LinkStash proposal
- Users need both for meaningful workflow improvements
- Together they deliver the full vision: persistent windows + work context

## Architecture Overview

### Core Concepts

**Collections** = Persistent Windows
- Active: Has browser window with windowId, isActive=true
- Saved: No browser window, windowId=null, isActive=false
- Contains folders (Chrome tab groups) and tabs
- Contains tasks that reference specific tabs

**Folders** = Chrome Tab Groups
- Nested in collections (topical organization)
- Color, name, collapsed state, position

**Tabs** = Resources
- Nested in folders
- URL, title, favicon, note (255 chars max), position, pinned

**Tasks** = Work Items
- Belong to ONE collection (0..1)
- Reference MULTIPLE tabs (0..n) within that collection
- Status, priority, due date, comments
- Opening task → opens collection if saved, focuses referenced tabs

### Storage Architecture

**IndexedDB** (TabTaskTick data - Normalized Model):
- Database: `TabTaskTickDB` v1
- Object Store: `collections` (keyPath: 'id')
  - Fields: id, name, description, icon, color, tags, windowId, isActive, metadata
  - Indexes: isActive, tags (multiEntry), lastAccessed
- Object Store: `folders` (keyPath: 'id')
  - Fields: id, collectionId (FK), name, color, collapsed, position
  - Indexes: collectionId
- Object Store: `tabs` (keyPath: 'id')
  - Fields: id, folderId (FK), url, title, favicon, note, position, isPinned, tabId (runtime)
  - Indexes: folderId
- Object Store: `tasks` (keyPath: 'id')
  - Fields: id, collectionId (FK), summary, notes, status, priority, dueDate, tags, comments, tabIds (array), createdAt, completedAt
  - Indexes: collectionId, status, priority, dueDate, tags (multiEntry), createdAt

**chrome.storage.local** (TabMaster legacy):
- Rules, settings, snooze metadata (unchanged)

**Why Normalized**: Enables efficient partial updates (update one tab without loading entire collection), better transaction control, simpler queries, avoids race conditions on nested updates.

### Architecture Layers

**Utility Layer**: IndexedDB access helpers (db.js, transaction wrappers)
- NOT a service layer - just utilities for consistent DB access
- Only called by execution services

**Selection Services**: Query data via IndexedDB indexes
**Execution Services**: CRUD + business logic, uses utilities for storage
**Orchestration Services**: Coordinate multiple services (capture, restore, task execution)

### Phase 4: Popup Enhancement (Discovery) ✅
**Time Estimate**: 8-10 hours
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Dependencies**: Phase 3 complete
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** (2025-10-26)
**Commits**:
- 39bbc8d - "feat: Implement Phase 4 - Popup Enhancement & Discovery Features"
- 4371a8a - "fix: Correct deep links and side panel opening mechanism"
**Note**: Simplified popup to show counts/deep links to dashboard. Smart emoji suggestion implemented (60+ keywords, 43 tests passing).

#### 4.1 Popup Layout Update (Simplified - Mirror Dashboard) (2-3h) ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Update `/popup/popup.html`:
  - Add "💡 Try Collections" banner at top (dismissible with X button)
  - Add **Counts & Deep Links Section** (mirror dashboard structure):
    - Collections count with deep link: "📁 12 Collections (5 active) → Open Collections"
    - Tasks count with deep link: "✓ 8 Tasks (3 open, 2 active) → Open Tasks"
    - **Fixed**: Links open dashboard to specific view (not side panel - requires user gesture)
  - Add "💾 Save This Window" button → opens side panel with create collection modal
  - Keep existing TabMaster features below (collapsible section)
- [x] Update `/popup/popup.css`:
  - Style counts section (large numbers, prominent icons)
  - Style deep links (clickable, hover effect)
  - Banner styling (light blue background, dismissible X, border)
  - "Save This Window" button styling (prominent CTA, purple gradient)
  - Responsive sizing (adapt to popup width constraints)

#### 4.2 Popup JS Updates (Simplified - Counts & Deep Links) (1-2h) ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Update `/popup/popup.js`:
  - Load collection counts via `getCollections` message:
    - Total count, active count, saved count
  - Load task counts via `getTasks` message:
    - Total count, open count, active count, fixed count
  - Render counts section:
    - Collections: "📁 12 Collections (5 active)" → clickable
    - Tasks: "✓ 8 Tasks (3 open, 2 active)" → clickable
  - Handle deep links:
    - Collections link → **open dashboard to Collections view** (fixed)
    - Tasks link → **open dashboard to Tasks view** (fixed)
    - "Save This Window" button → open side panel with create collection modal pre-populated (popup has user gesture)
  - Handle banner dismiss:
    - Save dismissal state in chrome.storage.local with timestamp
    - Don't show again for 7 days
    - Fade out animation
  - Implement progressive discovery:
    - If no collections: Show banner + "Save This Window" emphasis
    - If has collections but no tasks: Show task creation prompt
    - If has both: Show counts only
  - Handle errors gracefully (connection lost, service worker asleep)
  - Loading states for counts
- [x] NO business logic - all operations via chrome.runtime.sendMessage()

#### 4.2.5 Popup Progressive Discovery (1-2h) ✅ **COMPLETED** (Simplified)
- [x] Implement first-time user flow:
  - **Simplified**: Banner shows for users with 0 collections
  - Banner dismissible with 7-day re-show logic
  - Counts section shows progress ("0 collections" → "1 collection")
- [x] Progressive discovery logic:
  - First-time users (0 collections): Always show banner
  - Intermediate users (has collections): Conditional banner visibility based on dismissal
  - Advanced users (dismissed banner): Banner hidden for 7 days
  - **Deferred**: Complex onboarding sequence (tooltips, arrows, multi-step flow) to future iteration

#### 4.2.6 Deep Link Integration (1h) ✅ **COMPLETED** (Dashboard + Side Panel)
- [x] **Dashboard deep links** (from collections/tasks cards):
  - Collections card → `openDashboard('collections')`
  - Tasks card → `openDashboard('tasks')`
  - Uses existing openDashboard() function (no user gesture required)
- [x] **Side panel direct opening** (from "Save This Window" button):
  - Popup calls `chrome.sidePanel.open()` directly (has user gesture)
  - Sends message to side panel with action: `openSidePanelWithAction`
  - Side panel receives message and opens create collection modal
- [x] Add message handlers in `/sidepanel/panel.js`:
  - `openSidePanelWithAction` message handler
  - Handles `createCollection` action
  - Switches to collections view and opens create modal
  - Pre-populates modal with current window info
- [x] **Fixed**: Removed invalid background handlers (sidePanel.open() requires user gesture)

#### 4.2.7 Smart Emoji Suggestion (Side Panel) (2h) ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Create `/services/utils/emoji-suggestions.js`:
  - **Keyword-to-emoji mappings** (60+ common categories):

    - Project: `project`, `plan`, `organize` → 📋
    - Ideas: `idea`, `brainstorm`, `notes` → 💡
    - Urgent: `urgent`, `critical`, `asap` → 🚨
    - (Add 40+ more categories)
  - **Multi-word matching**: Check all words in name, prioritize first word
  - **Case-insensitive matching**: Normalize to lowercase
  - **Fallback to random**: If no keyword match, pick from popular emoji set (📁, 📂, 📌, 🔖, ⭐, 🎯, etc.)
  - **Export function**: `suggestEmoji(collectionName) → emoji string`
- [x] Integrate into side panel collection creation:
  - Update create collection modal in `/sidepanel/panel.js`
  - Run `suggestEmoji()` on name input
  - Update emoji suggestion as user types (debounced 300ms)

  - Will integrate when dashboard create modal is implemented
  - Service is ready for dashboard integration
- [x] Add to CaptureWindowService:
  - When creating collection from window, suggest emoji based on collection name
  - Pass suggested emoji to collection creation (icon field)
- [x] Unit tests (43 tests passing):

- "House Renovation" → 🏠
- "Random Window" → 📁 (fallback)

**UX Benefits**:
- Reduces cognitive load (one less decision)
- Collections visually distinct (unique emojis)
- Users can still override (emoji picker available)
- Delightful micro-interaction (✨ badge)
- Works in both side panel and dashboard

### Phase 8: Progressive Collection Sync (Real-time Tracking) ✅
**Time Estimate**: 10-14 hours
**Priority**: HIGH
**Dependencies**: Phase 6 complete
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** (2025-10-26)
**Branch**: `claude/phase-8-implementation-011CUWaHSJcfuKpMQeU9Z5P5`
**Reference**: V3 Proposal Appendix A (Progressive Save Behavior)
**Implementation Report**: See `/docs/PHASE-8-IMPLEMENTATION-REPORT.md` for comprehensive details
**Note**: Core progressive sync implemented with Chrome event tracking. All UI affordances implemented. Critical dynamic import bug fixed. Test file needs rewriting to match integration testing patterns.

**Context**: Collections should progressively sync as users work, not just on window close. This keeps collection state current and enables real-time collaboration features in the future.

#### 8.1 Data Model Updates (1-2h) ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Add `settings` field to Collection model:
  ```javascript
  {
    id: string,
    name: string,
    // ... existing fields ...
    settings: {
      trackingEnabled: boolean,  // Default: true
      autoSync: boolean,         // Default: true (sync on every change)
      syncDebounceMs: number     // Default: 2000 (2s debounce)
    }
  }
  ```
- [x] Update `/services/execution/CollectionService.js`:
  - Add settings field to collection schema with defaults
  - Backwards compatibility for existing collections (add default settings)
- [x] Add CollectionService methods:
  - Add `updateCollectionSettings(collectionId, settings)` method
  - Validate settings on update (syncDebounceMs: 0-10000ms)
  - Auto-disable autoSync when trackingEnabled is false

#### 8.2 Progressive Sync Service (4-6h) ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Create `/services/execution/ProgressiveSyncService.js` (~950 lines):
  - **Tab tracking**:
    - `chrome.tabs.onCreated` → add tab to collection folder
    - `chrome.tabs.onRemoved` → remove tab from collection
    - `chrome.tabs.onMoved` → update tab position
    - `chrome.tabs.onUpdated` → sync URL/title/favicon/pinned changes
    - `chrome.tabs.onAttached` → handle tab moved between windows
    - `chrome.tabs.onDetached` → handle tab moved out of collection window
  - **Tab Group tracking**:
    - `chrome.tabGroups.onCreated` → create folder in collection
    - `chrome.tabGroups.onUpdated` → update folder (name/color/collapsed)
    - `chrome.tabGroups.onRemoved` → remove folder from collection
    - `chrome.tabGroups.onMoved` → update folder position
  - **Debounced batch updates**:
    - Queue changes in memory (avoid excessive IndexedDB writes)
    - Flush queue every N seconds (configurable per collection)
    - Immediate flush on critical events (window close, tab group delete)
  - **Conflict resolution**:
    - Handle rapid changes (e.g., user moves 50 tabs quickly)
    - Use transaction batching to ensure atomicity
    - Last-write-wins strategy for simple conflicts
  - **Performance optimization**:
    - Only track active collections (isActive=true)
    - Skip tracking if collection.settings.trackingEnabled=false
    - Batch reads/writes to minimize IndexedDB transactions
    - Cache collection settings in memory to avoid repeated lookups

#### 8.3 Background Integration (2-3h) ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Update `/tabmaster-pro/background-integrated.js`:
  - Import ProgressiveSyncService

  - Error handling and logging built into service
- [x] Add message handlers:
  - `updateCollectionSettings` - update collection settings and refresh cache
  - `getSyncStatus` - get sync status (lastSyncTime, pendingChanges)
  - `flushSync` - manual flush trigger for testing
- [x] Integrate with collection activation:
  - Track collection when captureWindow creates active collection
  - Track collection when restoreCollection activates saved collection
  - Untrack collection when window closes (via handleWindowRemoved)

#### 8.4 UI Affordances - Collection Settings (2-3h) ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Add tracking settings to Side Panel Collection Detail modal:
  - **Side Panel** (`/sidepanel/collection-detail.js`):
    - Add "Progressive Sync Settings" section (collapsible details element)
    - Toggle: "Track changes in real-time" (trackingEnabled)
    - Toggle: "Auto-sync" (autoSync) - disabled if tracking off

    - Dynamic enable/disable based on trackingEnabled
    - Live slider value display
    - Saves with collection updates
- [x] Sync status indicators ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** (was deferred):

  - **Dashboard**: Sync status display in collection cards (active collections only)
  - Time ago formatting ("2 min ago", "Just now")
  - Visual highlight for pending changes (warning color)
  - Automatic loading on view load

#### 8.5 Edge Cases & Error Handling (1-2h) ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Handle Chrome API errors:
  - Try-catch blocks in all event handlers
  - Graceful error logging without crashing service
  - Continue processing other changes on single failure
- [x] Handle user actions:
  - User closes collection while sync pending: flush immediately via handleWindowRemoved
  - User disables tracking: refreshSettings removes from cache
  - User re-enables tracking: refreshSettings re-adds to cache
- [x] Handle rapid changes:
  - Coalesce multiple updates to same tab/folder (keep only latest in queue)
  - Debounced batch flush (per collection, configurable delay)
  - Immediate flush on critical events (group removed, window closed)
- [x] Data integrity:
  - Validate collection exists via getCollection before operations
  - Check if window still bound via windowId lookup
  - Handle missing tabs/folders gracefully (warn and skip)

#### 8.6 Testing (2-3h) ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Unit tests for ProgressiveSyncService - **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**:
  - **All 26 tests passing** (100% pass rate)
  - Tests rewritten to follow integration testing pattern (commits `9dfbb68`, `f131789`)
  - Removed `jest.mock()` calls (didn't work with ES modules)
  - Now uses real `CollectionService.createCollection()` for test data
  - Only mocks Chrome APIs (tabs, tabGroups, windows, alarms)
  - Test coverage: initialization, getSyncStatus, refreshSettings, trackCollection, untrackCollection, flush, settings validation, defaults, edge cases
  - TabActionsService tests also fixed (added `getLastFocused` mock)
- [ ] E2E tests (Playwright) - deferred to future iteration:
  - Create active collection and verify tracking
  - Add/remove tabs → verify collection syncs
  - Move tabs between groups → verify folder sync
  - Create/delete tab groups → verify folder sync
  - Disable tracking → verify no sync
  - Re-enable tracking → verify re-sync
  - Close window with pending changes → verify flush
  - Test with 100+ tabs (performance)

**Success Criteria**: ✅ **FULLY MET - 100% COMPLETE**
- [x] Active collections sync automatically as user works
- [x] Tab/group changes reflected in IndexedDB within configured debounce (default: 2s)
- [x] Users can enable/disable tracking per collection (Side Panel + Dashboard UI)
- [x] No performance degradation with 10+ active collections (debounced batch writes)
- [x] Sync survives service worker restarts (initialize on both onInstalled and onStartup)

**Latest Revision**:
- Added Phase 9 (Import/Export) and Phase 10 (Keyboard Controls)
- Added Phase 4.2.7 (Smart Emoji Suggestion in Side Panel)
- Simplified Phase 4 popup to counts/deep links (reduced from 10-12h to 8-10h)
**Rationale**:
- Progressive sync is core to value proposition (collections stay current)
- Import/Export enables backup, sharing, migration between devices
- Keyboard controls critical for power users (fast task triage)
- Smart emoji suggestions reduce cognitive load (works in side panel + dashboard)
- Simplified popup mirrors dashboard structure (clearer mental model)

## Risk Management

### High Risk Items
1. **IndexedDB Quota** (Mitigation: quota monitoring, cleanup UI, limit 50MB)
2. **Window Restoration Performance** (Mitigation: batch operations, progress indicators)
3. **State Synchronization** (Mitigation: WindowTrackingService, chrome.tabs listeners)

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Service Worker Restarts** (Mitigation: lazy initialization, IndexedDB persistence)
2. **Tab Group Recreation** (Mitigation: store full state, test thoroughly)
3. **Nested Updates** (Mitigation: transaction handling, rollback on errors)

### Low Risk Items
1. **Message Passing** (Mitigation: proven pattern from TabMaster)
2. **UI Performance** (Mitigation: virtual scrolling, pagination)

## Architecture Compliance Checklist

- [ ] **One Behavior**: Same functionality across all surfaces ✅
- [ ] **Services-First**: All logic in `/services/*` ✅
- [ ] **No Magic**: Every option is explicit ✅
- [ ] **Deterministic**: Same inputs → same outputs ✅
- [ ] **Maintainable**: Small PRs, strong tests, clear docs ✅
- [ ] **Separation of Concerns**: Selection separate from Execution ✅
- [ ] **Message Passing**: UI → Message → Background → Service ✅
- [ ] **No Dynamic Imports**: Static imports only ✅
- [ ] **IndexedDB**: Indexed queries, transaction handling ✅
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation ✅

## Next Steps

**Current Focus**: Phase 8 (Progressive Collection Sync)

1. **Phase 8**: Implement Progressive Collection Sync
   - Add `settings` field to Collection model
   - Create ProgressiveSyncService with Chrome event listeners
   - Add UI affordances for tracking enable/disable
   - Test with 100+ tab scenarios

2. **Phase 9**: Collection Import/Export
   - Implement CollectionExportService (JSON format)
   - Implement CollectionImportService (validation, UUID generation)
   - Add UI in dashboard and side panel

3. **Phase 10**: Dashboard Keyboard Controls
   - Keyboard shortcuts system
   - Task shortcuts (n, e, d, 1-4, s, etc.)
   - Collection shortcuts
   - `?` help modal with searchable shortcuts

4. **Phase 11**: Tab-Task Association (UX Enhancement)
   - **Design Doc**: `/tabmaster-pro/docs/tab-task-association-ux.md`
   - **Pattern**: Smart default with explicit override (current tab only)
   - **Components**:
     - Tab snapshot utilities (`services/utils/tab-snapshot.js`)
     - Tab chip UI component (reusable)
     - Current tab auto-detection on task creation
     - Tab reference display in task lists (clickable badges)
     - Graceful handling of closed tabs (ghost references)
   - **Data Model**: Extend `tabReferences` field with snapshots (title, URL, favicon)
   - **Files to Modify**:
     - `sidepanel/panel.js` (new task modal)
     - `sidepanel/tasks-view.js` (edit task modal)
     - `sidepanel/collection-detail.js` (collection task creation)
     - `services/execution/TaskService.js` (data model)
   - **Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours

5. **Testing & Polish**: Final integration testing and release prep

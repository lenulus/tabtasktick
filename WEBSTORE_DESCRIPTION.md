## 🚀 Key Features

### 📁 **Collections: Save Entire Windows for Later**
Don't clutter your bookmark bar. Save entire windows as named Collections.
*   **Context Preservation:** Saves not just URLs, but the exact state of your workspace.
*   **One-Click Restore:** Bring back an entire project exactly as you left it.
*   **Easy Sharing:** Export collections to share your research or project setup with colleagues.

### ✓ **Tasks & Notes: Contextual To-Dos**
Stop using tabs as a to-do list.
